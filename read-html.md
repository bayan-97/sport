# the website 
**Every website should be designed for the
target audienceâ€”not just for ourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to understand** 
- *who your target audience is?
It can be helpful to ask some
questions about the people you
would expect to be interested in
the subject of your site.*
- *Why People Visit YOUR Website?
1: The first attempts to discover
the underlying motivations for
why visitors come to the site.*
2: *The second examines the
specific goals of the visitors.
These are the triggers making
them come to the site now.*

 ## *now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve
their goals quickly and effectively by desgin?*
1- **The aim is to create a diagram
of the pages that will be used
to structure the site. This is
known as a site map and it will
show how those pages can be
grouped.**

## WireFrames

*A lot of designers will take the
elements that need to appear on
each page and start by creating
wireframes. This involves
sketching or shading areas
where each element of the page
will go (such as the logo, primary
navigation, headings and main
bodies of text, user logins etc).*
# HTML5
**HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.**

header

## article
**The article element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.
This could be an individual
article or blog entry, a comment
or forum post, or any other
independent piece of content**
# inline element
Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements.
Examples of inline elements are
a, b, em, and img

# blockelement
-div
**The div element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
For example, you might create
a divmelement to contain all
of the elements for the header
of your site (the logo and the
navigation), or you might create
a div element to contain
comments from visitors.**
